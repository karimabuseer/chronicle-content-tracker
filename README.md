## Built With
- For the backend, we decided to use Node.js to run our server side applications. Express.js is used for our routing framework. Postgresql was used as our database manager. Mockup docs were created using Sketch.

## Usage
To setup the project:

1. Install Node using Homebrew (macOS/Linux) or via the [Node.js website!](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Windows)
2. Navigate to the local project directory and install dependencies: 
```
npm install
npm install -g --save sequelize-cli
```

3. Tests are run using the Jest testing suite. To run tests:

Start the server in the test environment:
```
NODE_ENV=test npm start
```

then run

``` 
npm test
```
*To run tests with a coverage report*
```
yarn test --coverage
```
4. Create a role for the test database. Connect to psql and run the following commands:
```
CREATE ROLE noodle_eater WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'r@m3n!';
ALTER ROLE noodle_eater CREATEDB;
```

5. Create a database plus a test user to make changes to it using the following PSQL commands: 
```
sequelize db:create
```

6. To update the databases, you'll need to install sequelize

```
npm install -g sequelize-cli
```
and then access sequelize JS package via the command line: 
```
sequelize db:migrate
sequelize db:migrate --env test
```

7. To run the project in the developer environment:
```
npm start
```

or after setting it to the test environment:

```
NODE_ENV=development npm start
```
